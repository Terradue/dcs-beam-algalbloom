Algal bloom detection with Envisat MERIS
========================================

This tutorial is based on the work done in the context of the ESA Cat-1 project "Production of global MERIS MCI composite images for detection of plankton blooms and other events" submitted by Dr. Jim Gower.
The application will produce global daily composites of the MERIS MCI signal to locate and map phytoplankton blooms and other types of aquatic vegetation.
