Addressing a scientific / processing goal

This tutorial is based on the work done in the context of the ESA Cat-1 project "Production of global MERIS MCI composite images for detection of plankton blooms and other events" submitted by Dr. Jim Gower.

The application produces global daily composites of the MERIS MCI signal to locate and map phytoplankton blooms and other types of aquatic vegetation.

The MCI (Maximum Chlorophyll Index) shows the amplitude of a peak near 705 nm in the spectrum of top-of-atmosphere radiance, which is associated with high levels of chlorophyll a in ocean, coastal and lake water targets, such as plankton blooms and floating or benthic plants.

The index is unique to MERIS, in that the band at 709 nm is not present on either MODIS or SeaWiFS.
